# Data-Visualisation-Project

This repository contains the Group 34 Data Visualisation project for COS30045. Our project focuses on analysing and presenting key insights from Australia’s roadside drug-testing data through a series of interactive charts and a well-designed dashboard website. The visualisations explore trends in positive drug test detections, jurisdictional differences, detection methods, enforcement actions, and age-group patterns. All datasets were pre-processed and cleaned using KNIME before being imported into our web visualisation environment. The website, built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and D3.js, includes a homepage, five dedicated chart pages, and an interactive Australian map designed to help users quickly understand regional road-safety contexts. This project demonstrates our group’s ability to translate raw road-safety data into clear, accessible, and visually engaging insights suitable for stakeholders and the general public.
